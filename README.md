# CNN_Project
# üê± vs üê∂ CNN Image Classifier

## üåü Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using Python and Keras/TensorFlow to classify images as either a **Cat** or a **Dog**. This is a classic and foundational computer vision problem that demonstrates the power of deep learning for image recognition.

### Project Goal
To develop a robust CNN model capable of distinguishing between cat and dog images with a high degree of accuracy (target > 90%).

### Key Features
* **Custom CNN Architecture:** A sequential model built from scratch, utilizing key layers such as `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense` layers. 
* **Data Augmentation:** Implements real-time image data augmentation (e.g., rotation, shifting, flipping) during training to prevent **overfitting** and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.
* **Transfer Learning (Optional Enhancement):** The code structure can be easily adapted to implement transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.
* **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model weights and architecture (`.h5` file) for quick re-use and deployment.
